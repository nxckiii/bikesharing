 # bikesharing

The purpose of the project is to analyze NYC Citi Bike data, and create a visualization in a different location such as in Des Moines.

There was an error on my CSV file. The time duration didn't change to a timestamp, instead, it said "null." After talking to the LA Team, they assisted me to change it to a string that finally represented the time stamp. There wasn't enough time to continue and finish the challenge.
